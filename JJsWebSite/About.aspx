        About me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I live in a small city in The Netherlands.
        I work as a software developer. The past 3 months I have been looking for a new 
        job and it&#39;s been driving me crazy, but finally I found one. Usually most of my time 
        goes into software development. I work on it during the day, in the evening, on weekends.
        I guess that makes me a bit of a workaholic. Now the job hunt is over I will be 
        working on studying software development tools, updating my document templates 
        and getting all phylosophical about computer technology.
        Software development is a great passion of mine.</p>
    <p>
        When I watch TV I have I admit to have a preference for comedy, cartoons and (popular) science shows. 
        The piano is gathering dust. I vaguely remember it being a hobby of mine. I 
        don&#39;t do that as much as I used to, because I have made room for my studies and my computer-related obsessions.</p>
    <p>
        I live on my own in my own house. I like visiting family. I like to go out, 
        but I do it less than I should.
